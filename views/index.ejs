          I was born and raised in Houston, TX, went to NYC for college, and am currently living in the northern
          Virginia (NOVA) area.
          Like most people, I love to travel, eat, sleep, and explore. I'm also really into cooking, cardio
          boxing/kickboxing, and any sort of arts and crafts.
          I tend to go through phases, picking up and dropping hobbies frequently, but I just really love trying new
          things ðŸ˜…

        <p>
          During my time at Capital One, I've been through a 6 month training program (<a target="_blank"
            href="https://campus.capitalone.com/coda-program/">CODA</a>), and, as part of the rotational program (<a
            target="_blank" href="https://campus.capitalone.com/technology-program">TDP</a>), I worked as a full stack
          developer for one year before switching to my current role as a site reliability engineer. In these roles, I
          gained experience ranging from design to full stack development to devops.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've worked on many web applications that used Angular 4 or 7 for frontend, Java/Spring, Node/GraphQL, or
          Python/Django for backend, and Postgres and Elasticsearch for data storing. I also learned how to deploy our
          applications using AWS, Jenkins, and some Terraform.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          At Capital One, there have also been many opportunities for me to network, volunteer, and engage with my community. As a member of the TDP Fun committee, I helped plan and organize monthly social events for associates in the TDP program, as well as monthly virtual events once we had to switch to working from home.

        <p>
          In the summer before my senior year of college, I had the opportunity to intern at Wells Fargo in their Prime
          Services department. My main project was to implement new charting components to replace an old library that
          was being used in their client-facing portal. As this was my first job in the technology field, I learned a
          lot about agile practices, how to work and collaborate with other team members, and how the SLDC really works
          in a big company.

        <h2 class="section-subheader">Tutoring (Various)</h2>
        <h4 class="section-subheader">2013 - 2018</h4>
        <p>
          Ever since high school, I've worked a range of tutoring and after school teaching jobs. I actually started by
          working for my mom, who, a life long educator, opened up an after school learning center for students K-12.
          The students I worked with the most there were students who had just come from China to study in the US, so
          they mainly struggled with the language. I would work with them on English and Language Arts and help them
          practice for the SAT, ACT, and TOEFL. One summer, we actually even organized a partnership with a summer camp
          in China, where a few tutors from our tutoring center went to China to help teach English to students in the
          camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          In college, I worked part time as a student teacher assistant at a local elementary school in New York during
          my freshman and sophomore years. During my senior year, I was a weekend math teacher at a tutoring center in
          Brooklyn, and I continued to work there for a few months after I graduated, as well as tutor at the Brooklyn
          Educational Opportunity Center on the weekdays. While most of my experience was tutoring younger students, at
          the BEOC I learned how to work with and tutor adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, despite getting frustrated many times at students for not understanding, at problems for being too
          complicated, at myself for not being patient enough, I loved teaching and was always eager to help. Even after
          all these years of teaching, I still have a ways to go to be a good educator, and though I don't do so much
          tutoring anymore, education is definitely something I want to do with my career in the future.
